# Learning New Programming Languages

This repository contains my attempts at exercises from <https://exercism.org/>.
All the boilerplate code in this repository is licensed under Exercism's MIT
license.

Each language lives in its own separate folder and I download them using the
exercism cli:

```
exercism download --track=<lang> --exercise=<ex>
```
